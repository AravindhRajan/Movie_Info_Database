# Movie_Info_Database
I 've seen many aspiring Data Scientists (including myself in the past) think about building machine learning models for prediction. The problem is that it is not until they gain some experience they understand the reality that model building is only a minimal part of a Data Scientist's typical job. 

One other thing which I recently realised is that, what good is a machine learning model when it is not consumable ? I had many such projects that were just sitting in my laptop. I also didn't want to go through the hassles of learning web development to build an application that uses my model in the backend. I stumbled across one of the frameworks which I would say is an awesome, light-weight, pythonic library to build apps with minimal effort.

keywords: Machine Learning, Movie Recommendation System, Movie Database, Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This is an application that gives you information about the movie based on user's input and some recommendations based on the movie plot.This is a pet project attempted to sharpen my skills in Python and to make some good use of my available time. Any comments/suggestions/opinions/criticisms are welcome. Thanks a lot in advance.

Below is how the homepage would look like

* Enter the name of the movie.
* The 2nd field will show another list if there are multiple movies with the same name.
* It shows the below info in a tabular format
   * Movie
   * Release Year
   * IMDB ID
   * IMDB Rating
   * Genre
   * Runtime
   * Certificate
   * Language
followed by Lead Actor Name, Role Name and Director

In addition to showing a short plot of the movie, it also shows a list of movie recommendations based on the movie summary. You can choose the number of recommendations you want

_NOTE:This is just a crude attempt to demonstrate the possibilities of building a simple app on the fly that consumes your model in the backend. There are plenty of areas to improve and fine tune_
